Information Library
===
The Information Library is a gigantic collection of informative images from 4chan created by an anon called InformantB900. It composes 2,206 images containing guides, strange facts, and cool tips, organized in 180 folders. Who knows what kind of knowledge lurks in this collection?

> This Information Library isn't my work. It's OUR work as Anonymous. We made this, and this is for us to share. So continue to share as we continue to seek more information. I made this because I want to give back the community something for all the laughs and fucked up shit I've seen on here as I grew up lurking, like the underageb& that I was. And I did it simply because I could.
