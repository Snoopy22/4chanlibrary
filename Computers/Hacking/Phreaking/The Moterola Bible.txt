	This manual is not intended to be an aid in cellular fraud.  That is
both illegal and immoral.  Would you like someone to make charges on your
phone?  If you want free calls, you want to check elsewhere for information
pertaining to BOXES, which is NOT mentioned in the Motorola Bible.
	This manual is not intended for use by people with little electronics
experience.  This is not a tutorial and not intended to be used except by
people with previous cellular experience and are familiar with programming
cellular phones.  There are tons of introductory files all over the net.  For

	Before going in to the programming of the cellular phone, it is
important for the user to know the normal things necessary for day to day
operation.  While the majority of the stuff in the users manual is intended
for people that have problems programming their VCR, their are a few things
that are very important and are only mentioned in the users manual.

---------
What is EE3??

    EE3 is the software that Motorola has added to the cellular
product line which provides feature enhancements and increased 
security by restricting ESN transfer...
---------
Why did the changes take place...

     Due to the FCC Rule change, all new cellular telephones
that were introduced after Jan. 1, 1995 with new FCC IDs must restrict
ESN transfer. Phones introduced prior to this date are "grandfathered"
or not required to be compliant with this rule.
---------
How ya can tell the difference between an EE3 and a non-EE3 fone.

     These fones will be identified with the marking of EE3 on the
FCC label (look on da back of da fone)
---------
How does the fone change?!

     Some of the changes EE3 phones have are feature differences,
accessory compatibility, and service differences.
---------
Which fones have the PIN CODE feature?!

	If the phones has EE3 on the back label, then the fone has the
PIN CODE feature; with the exception of the EE3 TeleTacs and the 
pre-AC-P300 boxed contours.
---------
Can a 3-watt VA be used with EE3 fones?!

     No, the existing 3-watt VA is not compatible with EE3 fones.
The following part numbers are for the new 3-watt booster for EE3 fones
and for conversion kits for existing 3-watt kits.  The 3-watt booster
has its own handset that comes with it.

Deluxe Booster w/Micro Car Handsfree Kit (EE3 pocket and flip)
# S-5415
Deluxe Booster w/Micro Car Handsfree Kit (EE3 Elite) <no, eleet!>
# S-5093
Deluxe Booster Conversion Kit (EE3 pocket and flip)
# S-5094
Deluxe Booster Conversion Kit (EE3 Elite) 
# TBA
-----------
Which Motorola fones have the new Lock feature?!

    All EE3 fones have the NEW lock feature - FCN,5 and STO to lock it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, it seems alot of people have been trying to figure out the date of
manufacture of Motorola cellular phones.  This is easily accomplished by
locating the MSN (Mechanical Serial Number) somewhere on the telephone.  It can
be 10 or 11 digits.  If there is no 11th digit, warranty period is one year.  If
there is an 11th digit, the warranty period can be determined from the following
charts.  Without a proof of purchase, warranty date is determined by adding 3
months to the date of manufacture.

MSN Example: 194GSTxxxxW

		194 is the Accounting Product Code (APC) and has little use.
		  G is the location of manufacture
		  S is the Year Code of manufacture
		  T is the Month Code of manufacture
	       xxxx is the actual serial number (hex) of that telephone 
		  W is the Warranty Period

Year Code Year   Month Code Month                  Warranty Period Defenition

There are MANY different models of Motorola phones sold under various
brand names, if you think it's a Motorola, it probably is.

Determine which access sequence to use:

HAND HELD PORTABLE MODELS

If the phone has a FCN button and no MENU button use sequence 1.
If the phone has no FCN button use sequence 2.
If the phone has a MENU button and a FCN button use sequence 4.

INSTALLED MOBILE PHONES AND TRANSPORTABLE MODELS

If the phone has no FCN button and no RCL button use sequence 3.
If the phone has a FCN button use sequence 4.
If the phone has a MEM button use sequence 5.
If the phone has a RCL button and no FCN button use sequence 6.


SEQUENCE#     ACCESS CODE

1             FCN   (SECURITY CODE TWICE) RCL
2             STO # (SECURITY CODE TWICE) RCL
3             CTL 0 (SECURITY CODE TWICE) *
4             FCN 0 (SECURITY CODE TWICE) RCL
5             FCN 0 (SECURITY CODE TWICE) MEM
6             CTL 0 (SECURITY CODE TWICE) RCL

The default security code is 000000.  The CTL (control) button is the
single black button on the side of the handset.


NAM programing:

1.  Turn the power on.

2.  Within ten seconds enter the access sequence as determined above.

3.  The phone should now show "01" in the left of the display, this is the
    first programing entry step number.  If it does not the security code
    is incorrect, or the programing lock-out counter has been exceeded.  In
    either case you can still program the unit by following the steps under
    TEST MODE PROGRAMING below.

4.  The * key is used to increment each step:

    Each time you press * the display will increment from the step number,
    displayed on the left, to the data stored in that step, displayed on
    the right.  When the data is displayed make any necessary changes and
    press * to increment to the next step number.

5.  The SND key is used to complete and exit programing when any STEP
    NUMBER is displayed.

    If you have enabled the second phone number bit in step 10 below then
    pressing SND will switch to NAM 2.  Steps 01 thru 06, 09 and 10 will
    repeat for NAM 2, the step number will be followed by a "2" to indicate
    NAM two.

5.  The CLR key will revert the display to the previously stored data.

6.  The # key will abort programing at any time.


PROGRAMING DATA:

STEP#    #OF DIGITS/RANGE    DESCRIPTION

01       00000 - 32767       SYSTEM ID
02       3 DIGITS            AREA CODE
03       7 DIGITS            TEL NUMBER
04       2 DIGITS            STATION CLASS MARK
05       2 DIGITS            ACCESS OVERLOAD CLASS
06       2 DIGITS            GROUP ID (10 IN USA)
07       6 DIGITS            SECURITY CODE
08       3 DIGITS            LOCK CODE
09       0333 OR 0334        INITIAL PAGING CHANNEL
10       6 DIGIT BINARY      OPTION PROGRAMING (SEE NOTE 1)
11       3 DIGIT BINARY      OPTION PROGRAMING (SEE NOTE 2)


NOTES:

Take care with Motorola's use of "0" and "1".  Some options use "0" to
enable, some use "1".

1.  This is a 6 digit binary field used to select the following options:

    Digit 1:  Internal handset speaker, 0 to enable.
    Digit 2:  Local Use Mark, 0 or 1.
    Digit 3:  MIN Mark, 0 or 1.
    Digit 4:  Auto Recall, always set to 1 (enabled).
    Digit 5:  Second phone number (not all phones), 1 to enable.
    Digit 6:  Diversity (Two antennas, not all phones), 1 to enable.

2.  This is a 3 digit binary field used to select the following options:

    Digit 1:  Continuous DTMF, 1 to enable.
    Digit 2:  Transportable Ringer/Speaker, 0=Transducer, 1=Handset.
    Digit 3:  8 hour time out in transportable mode, 0 to enable.


On newer models, they have added and changed some numbers.  The numbers
as of the 3/27/92 manual are as follows:

1.  The 6 digit binary field is still the same.  

2.  The 3 digit binary field has become a 5 digit binary field.
    
    Digit 1:  Failed Page Indicator                        1=Disabled;0=Enabled
    Digit 2:  Motorola Enhanced Scan                       1=Enabled; 0=Disabled
    Digit 3:  Long Tone DTMF                               1=Enabled; 0=Disabled
    Digit 4:  Transportable Internal Ringer Speaker        1=Handset; 0=Transdcr
    Digit 5:  Eight Hour Timeout                           1=Disabled;0=Enabled

			      TEST MODE ACCESS:

NEWER 95xx PHONES (Thank you Motorola!!!)

  Many newer phones don't require grounding.  If your software version number
  is 9526 (I think) or newer, enter this:

  FCN + 0 + 0 + * + * + 8 3 7 8 6 6 3 3 + STO
  
  In case you have trouble remembering the number sequence, it spells out 
  "TESTMODE."  Leave it to Motorola to make this easier and easier all the time.
  I have used this and it does work.  This command just backs up my claim even
  further that esn changing via handset is a reality.  It's a matter of finding
  the correct combination of keys. 
 
  Normal test mode commands work like usual from then on.

  For some odd reason, this hasn't been included in all the 95xx phones.  I 
  believe they started it in Software 9526.  This is only an estimate, so if
  you have a 95xx flip, let me know what software version you have and whether
  it works or not so this date can be isolated.  Mine is a 9562 that worked.

INSTALLED MOBILE PHONES AND TRANSPORTABLE MODELS

To enter test mode on units with software version 85 and higher you must
short pins 20 and 21 of the transceiver data connector.  An RS232 break out
box is useful for this, or construct a test mode adaptor from standard
Radio Shack parts.

For MINI TR or Silver Mini Tac transceivers (smaller data connector) you
can either short pins 9 and 14 or simply use a paper clip to short the
hands free microphone connector.

HAND HELD PORTABLE MODELS:

There are two basic types of Motorola portable phones, the Micro-Tac series
"Flip" phones, and the larger 8000 and Ultra Classic phones.  Certain newer
Motorola and Pioneer badged Micro-Tac phones do not have a "flip", but
follow the same procedure as the Micro-Tac.

8000 & ULTRA CLASSIC SERIES:

If you have an 8000 series phone determine the "type" before trying to
enter test mode.  On the back of the phone, or on the bottom in certain
older models, locate the F09... number this is the series number.  If the
FOURTH digit of this number is a "D" you CAN NOT program the unit through
test mode, a Motorola RTL4154/RTL4153 programer is required to make any
changes to this unit.

Having determined that you do not have a "D" series phone the following
procedure is used to access test mode:

Remove the battery from the phone and locate the 12 contacts at the top
near the antenna connector.  These contacts are numbered 1 through 12 from
top left through bottom right.  Pin 6, top right, is the Manual Test Mode
Pin. You must ground this pin while powering up the phone.  Pin 7 (lower
left) or the antenna connector should be used for ground.  Follow one of
these procedures to gain access to pin 6:

1.  The top section of the battery that covers the contacts contains
nothing but air.  By careful measuring you can drill a small hole in the
battery to gain access to pin 6, alternately simply cut the top off the
battery with a hack saw.  Having gained access use a paper clip to short
pin six to the antenna connector ground while powering up the phone.

2.  If you do not want to "destroy" a battery you can apply an external 7.5
volts to the + and - connectors at the bottom of the phone, ground pin 6
while powering up the phone as above.

3.  You can also try soldering or jamming a small jumper between pins 6 and
7 (top right to lower left), or between pin 6 and the antenna connector
housing ground.  Carefully replace the battery and power up the phone.  Use
caution with this method not to short out any other pin.

4.  A cigarette lighter adaptor, if you have one, also makes a great test
mode adaptor as it can be disassembled to give you easier access to pin 6.
Many are pre marked, or even have holes in the right location.  This is
because they are often stamped from the same mold that the manufacturer
uses for making hands free adaptor kits and these kits require access to
the phone's connectors.

ULTRA CLASSIC II SERIES:

  Ground Pin 2 to pin 4.  

MICRO-TAC "FLIP" SERIES:

This phone follows similar methods as outlined for the 8000 series above.

Remove the battery and locate the three contacts at the bottom of the
phone, the two outer contacts are raised and connect with the battery.  The
center contact is recessed, this is the Manual Test Mode connector.

Now look at the battery contacts, the two outer ones supply power to the
phone, the center contact is an "extra" ground.  This ground needs to be
shorted to the test mode connector on the phone.  The easiest way to do
this is to put a small piece of solder wick, wire, aluminum foil or any
other conductive material into the recess on the phone.  Having done this
carefully replace the battery and turn on the power, if you have been
successful the phone will wake up in test mode.

GENERAL NOTES:

HANDSETS:  Most Motorola handsets are interchangeable, when a handset is
used with a transceiver other than the one it was designed for the display
will show "LOANER".  Some features and buttons may not work, for instance
if the original handset did not have a RCL or STO button, and the
replacement does, you will have to use the control * or control # sequence
to access memory and A/B system select procedures.

LOCK/UNLOCK PROCEDURES:

     Phones with "LOCK" buttons:  Press lock for at least 1/2 a second.

     Phones with a "FCN" button:  Press FCN 5, note that 5 has the letters
				  "J,K, and L" for lock.

     Phones with no FCN or LOCK button:  Press Control 5, control is the black
					 volume button on the side of the
					 handset.

SYSTEM SELECT PROCEDURES:

     Phones with a RCL button:  Press RCL *, then * to select, STO to store.

     Phones with no RCL button: Press Control * then * to select, # to store.

     Options are:    CSCAn:    Preferred/Non preferred with system lockout.
		     Std A/b, or Std b/A:  Preferred/Non preferred.
		     SCAn Ab, or SCAn bA:  Non preferred/Preferred
		     SCAn A:  "A" ONLY
		     SCAn b:  "B" ONLY
		     HOME:     Home only

     (these are typical options, some phone's vary.  C-Scan is only available 
     on newer models and does not appear unless programed, see below.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				 TEST MODE
    
NOTE: Not all commands work on all telephones.  If a command is not valid the
      display will show "ErrOr."  Not all numbers have been assigned.  Not all
      numbers have been listed here.  Some commands were intended only for
      Motorola factory applications.   (This is the disclaimer in the
      technical training manual.  I have included all of the other commands I 
      have discovered one way or another.  Some that say no function do have
      a function but it is unknown until it is figured out.)
    

Three test commands are significant for programming and registering the
the telephone for service:  see full descriptions under TEST MODE COMMANDS.

32#  Clears the telephone.  (Older Motorola allowed either three or fifteen 
changes in the MIN.  After that, the phone had to be sent to Motorola to reset 
the counter.  This is the command they use.) 

38#  Displays the ESN

55#  This is the TEST MODE PROGRAMMING (as described below).


			      TEST MODE DISPLAY:


Test mode consists of two separate levels.  When the telephone is first placed
in Test Mode, it is in the STATUS DISPLAY LEVEL.  The display will be scrolling
(or flashing), or it will be locked.  If locked, enter the unlock code and the
display will begin scrolling.  If the unlock code is not known, press #.  By
pushing the # key, the technician causes the cellular telephone to change to
its SERVICING LEVEL.  The display will be   US'  .  There are five types of
display, depending on the model of the telephone: a 16 character display, a 14
character display, a 10 digit display (with two versions), an 8 character
display, and a 7 character display.  The status display is different in analog
operation than in a TDMA call.

18#  C-Scan  (Allows for entry of as many as 5 negative SID's for each NAM.)

     Newer Motorola phones are equipped with a feature called C-Scan, this is 
     an option along with the standard A/B system selections.  C-Scan allows 
     the phone to be programed with up to five inhibited system ID's per NAM.  
     This is designed to prevent the phone from roaming onto specified non-home
     systems and therefore reduce "accidental" roaming fees.

     1.  C-Scan can only be programed from test mode, power phone up with the
	 relevant test mode contact grounded (see above).

     2.  Press # to access test mode.

     3.  Press 18#, the phone will display "0    40000".

     4.  Enter the first inhibited system ID and press *.

     Continue to enter additional system ID's if required.  After the 5th entry
     the phone will display "N2". Press * to continue and add system ID's for
     NAM 2 as required.

     5.  If an incorrect entry is made (outside the range of 00000-32767) the
	 display will not advance, press CLR and re-enter.  Use a setting of
	 40000 for any un-needed locations.

     6.  When the last entry has been made press * to store and press # to exit,
	 turn off power.

     or

     will terminate the command and display two three-digit numbers in the 
     display.  The first number is the number of correctable errors and the
     second is the uncorrectable errors.

21#  Received voice channel messages counting correctable and uncorrectable
     errors.  When the command starts, the number of the command will be 
     displayed in the upper right-hand corner of the display.  Entering a # 
     key terminates the command and will display two three-digit numbers in 
     display.  The first is the number of correctable errors and the second 
     is the uncorrectable errors.

22#  Receive control channel messages counting word sync sequence.  When the
     command starts, the number of the command will be displayed in the upper

55#  Display/Program N.A.M. (Test Mode Programming)

     TEST MODE PROGRAMING:

     Assuming you have completed one of the above steps correctly the phone
     will wake up in test mode when you turn the power on.  When you first
     access test mode the phone's display will alternate between various status
     information that includes the received signal strength and channel number.
     The phone will operate normally in this mode.  You can now access Service
     Mode by pressing the # key, the display will clear and a ' will appear.
     Use the following procedure to program the phone:

     1.  Enter 55# to access programing mode.

     2.  The * key advances to the next step.  (NOTE that test mode programing
	 does NOT have step numbers, each time you press the * key the phone 
	 will display the next data entry).

     3.  The CLR key will revert the display to the previously stored data.

     4.  The # key aborts programing at any time.

     5.  To complete programing you must scroll through ALL entries until a '
	 appears in the display.

     6.  Note that some entries contain more digits than can be displayed by the
	 phone, in this case only the last part of the data can be seen.

Note:  This is NOT my hack.  Thanks to Patrk@delphi.com for this addition.


		   HACKING THE FOVC
 

Problem:  When listening to something interesting (a conversation),
just when that sexy sounding horny broad begins to give her
phone number to some lucky guy, HANDOFF!!! then static... DAMN!
 
Trick:    Hack the FOVC.
 
    a quick definition:  FOVC  = FOward Voice Channel
			 FOCC  = FOward Control Channel
			 REVC  = REverse Voice Channel
			 RECC  = REverse Control Channel
 
As the phone travels through cells, the FOVC is where the tower tells
the phone to adjust power levels for the current cell or to change to
a new channel for use in the new cell. This info can be hacked apart.
So. When you've found a good conversation, don't be lazy! Enter 40#!
This makes the phone listen for commands on the voice channel
(embedded in the audio portion- you can hear it as a "bump" sound). It
will just sit there and the display will read '40' , but the
conversation will still be audible.  Now when the phone receives a
FOVC command (a 40 bit sequence) data will flow across the display, in
hex format, and stop. Listen to the phone, if the conversation is
still there, then the command was only to adjust power levels. If the
conversation is gone, then its a handoff. If you only got a power
adjustment command just press # or clr,  which ever gets you back to
the ' prompt. Enter 40# and keep listening. You can also use the # key
to cancel the 40# command, if you want to change channels or something.
 
If it was a handoff, its time for some quick math. You have to convert
some of the numbers to binary, and then to decimal. I don't know how
many characters your phone's display will show. Mine only shows the
last seven of the ten hex digits. Count left from the end 6 digits.
Write down that digit and the next two on a piece of paper, ie:
 
 
    ???j16djjj    j=junk numbers  (hex numbers range from 0-9,a-f)
    / \
    these are lost due to scrolling
 
       write down  16d then convert it to a binary string:
 
       1 = 0001
       6 = 0110
       d = 1101    (d=13)
 
       now you have a binary string like this:  000101101101
       throw away the first 2 bits and get:       0101101101
       convert this to decimal and get:                  365
 
 
365 is the new channel the conversation has moved to! Enter 110365#
and voila! You too, can hear the horny babe's phone number!
 
Don't forget to enter 40# again, as the call may be moving quickly
through cells ( small cells or freeway driving ) or the call can get
bounced around by the tower for cell traffic purposes.
 
Here's one more example of the hex>binary>decimal conversion.
 
	???j5aejjj
 
	5  =  0101
	a  =  1010
	e  =  1110
 
	full string        = 010110101110
	truncate 2 msb     =   0110101110
	convert to decimal =          430

READING THE SID WITH THE MOTOROLA PHONE
---------------------------------------

-----------=?> Doctor Who <?=----------

This document is copyright by the author, and may be redistributed without
charge as long as it is not changed in any way. No user other than the author
or his assignees may charge for distribution of this document.

Written on March 19, 1995. A sunny, but still somewhat cold sunday.

The SID (System IDentification) of a control channel can be determined using
the test mode of the Motorola cellular phone. This document assumes the reader
understands cellular technology in general, and how to access Motorola's test
mode in specific.

Tune the phone to the desired control channel with 11xxx# where XXX is the 
channel number. Hit 39# to receive one control channel word. One should appear
in less than two seconds, filling up all ten digits on the display with hexa-
decimal digits. Do this repeatedly until one is found with the correct 
pattern. Digit places start at the left hand side and go to the right.

The first digit should be C, D, E, or F. This letter can be used to determine the
DCC/SAT of the cell. A "C" is SAT 0, D is 1, E is 2, and F is 3. Ignore digits
8, 9, and 10. They are parity bytes. Digit 7 should be "6" or "E", though I
have never found it to be other than "E". The hexadecimal value of represented
by digits 2 through 5 is then divided by two, and then 1 added if the carrier
is a "A" side, "non-wireline" carrier. The result is the System ID.

for example:

E00388EA08

E means this cell has an SAT/DCC of 3. The A08 is ignored. The E to the left of
it is proper and normal, so this is the right kind of message. Ignore the 8 in
position 6, that is, just to the left of the E. 0038 in hexadecimal translates
((3*16=48)+8))  to 56. 56/2 = 28. Looking up System ID 28 on my chart indicates
Nynex in Boston. This is correct.

Please be aware that the two SID charts I have seen around the net are very
outdated. I have a more recent version on paper which I may eventually type in,
when I have the time and energy.

The methods used above are only a very crude way to do what could be done
much more efficiently by computer. I am sure that programs will be written to
do exactly this, but I am holding off until I have thoroughly hacked the
meaning of all these types of messages before writing such a program. I am 
also contemplating the design of a cable to replace the handset, running 
from the 25 pin connector on the side of my Bag Phone to a computer.

OK OK OK.  Here are the cable specs.  They are 100% correct.  Of course I
wouldn't know because these are for information purposes only.  I have been
told however by VERY reliable sources that they are guaranteed, 100%, GRADE-A,
correct.  If they don't work for you, you did something wrong.

Frequency Calculation for Channels 1-799:

		  Forward (Mobile RX) Frequency = 870.00 MHz + (Ch.# X .030 MHz)
									       
Frequency Calculation for Channels 991-1023:
	 Reverse (Mobile TX) Frequency = 825.00 MHz - [.030 MHz X (1023 - Ch.#)]
	 Forward (Mobile RX) Frequency = 870.00 MHz - [.030 MHz X (1023 - Ch.#)]

To determine the center frequency of an associated NAMPS sub-channel in these
formulas, subtract 10 kHz from the restult for the low sub-channel, leave the 
result as is for the center sub-channel, and add 10 kHz to the result for the 
high sub-channel.

The following text I took from the Poisoned Pen BBS (Hi guys).  Thanks Jakey
for taking the time to decipher all of this shit.  As far as I know, with 
the exception of a post on #cellular and the upload to Poisoned Pen, there is
nothing in print with this compilation.  Again, special thanks go to Jakey
(jbs@mcs.net) for the long, seemingly endless work.

I got this from a bbs in the (708) are code.  It had no name associated
with it.  Since NOONE has mailed me any other info on it, I will keep this
in the bible until someone bitches or sends me something tangible.  Besides,
with Loadkit so readily available, who has the time to mess with it?

			      MOTOROLA "TRIK-CLIP"


This is the plans I recieved for the Flip.  Supposedly if one knew the
pinouts on the other moto phones one could transpose. (maybe!)  I never
tested this so I don't know if it works.  The chip in the flip the text
is talking about is a 32 pin square plcc

After Phone Disassembly Locate 27c512 Eprom on phone board.  This is
On The Upper Right Side Of The Display Next To The Roam Indicator.
This Is a 32 pin Square device.  **Note the dot and beveled edge
for pin orientation (the dot is pin 1) Count to the left
counter clock wise 2 3 4 5 and so on.  To the Right or clockwise
of the dot is pin 32 Vcc.  This will aid you in your count to find
pin 25 which is the eprom output enable.  This pin is at ground or
Vss - Level.  **Note Pin 25 on Eprom in phone must be lifted from
the phone board ground or Vss state.  Use an X-acto Knife and or
soldering iron and tools to cut pin at board level where pin
narrows.  Do not bend wide part of pin up on eprom as this could
break off of Eprom.  Also Wide Part of pin Will be used to make
contact with eprom test clip adapter.  The eprom test clip adapter
will take pin 25 to logic high through an 8 to 10 thousand
resistor to pin 32 Vcc.  This will Gate off all data Commands from
the phone board eprom and allow the eprom test clip adaptor to
take over.  **Note test clip could touch narrow part of cut off
pin on board and cause phone not to power up please remove or fold
down as low as possible so test clip only touches side of eprom.

After programing is complete put pin 25 back together or find a
suitable ground or Vss - source.  The phone will power up and work
without pin 25 put back together but for long term precaution
put back to a logic zero or ground to enable the output enable.

To use the eprom test clip adapter pull the locking wedge on the
test clip into the upper position.  Seat the eprom test clip adapter
onto the eprom in the phone.  Make sure to orient the dot and
beveled edge with each other.  Push the locking wedge down to lock
the the eprom test clip adapter onto the eprom in the phone.  Hook up
the programing cable to the computer and plug into the jack on the
base of the phone.  Also hook up the loose lead with a jumper to the
center terminal between the battery contacts.  Turn power on green
light on phone display should come on then a complete display test
will light up after that the no service will blink along with the
signal level mark in corner of display.  If the antenna is still on
the phone it could change to roam or something else.  I  suggest
remove the antenna so the cell sight will not see you.  If you do
not get a power on test with the display there are 3 possible
things (1) pin 25 on phone board is touching the test clip this
can be checked by looking with a volt meter at pin 25 where
resistor connects for 4 to 5 volts pos with reference to ground.
(2) Test clip is not sitting on chip good some times you have pull
the test clip up off of the eprom a 64th of an inch all the way
around.  (3) there is corrupt data, Pull the eprom test clip off
Phone check to see if power on display is there.

Computer see if data or phone number or cell sight code or data
whole is ok I've seen the cell sight ID corrupt and the phone play
dead on  the power on test. The test clip sometimes needs
maintenance look at the gold pins.

Make sure all the pins are level with the edge of it.  If not take
an X-acto or pin and lightly bend them out so they are along the
edge of the plastic of the test clip.

Always check to see if eprom in phone contacts are clean before
putting test clip on.  **Note when test clip is on phone - only
change the ESN only. *The other data phone number lock and so on
can be changed without the test clip and and should be done so.

The software version in the test clip is 9148 you will see this in
the right corner of the computer.  Sometimes the program will crash
during the ESN write this will put all zeros in the ESN field
check the test clip try again.  Sometimes I've had to do this 3 or 4
times.  Also watch the phone display for codes I've seen at the end
of a wright the code (FO8) just before power down I've had no
problem there but during the key wright (FO8) means I've crashed.

Also during the time when the program is counting back into the
phone I've had (F1O) show up in the display of the phone this
problem means the next time you may not get the power on display
test pull test clip read phone check data to see if cell sight
code is corrupt or some other data correct try again.  A word of
caution do not push on eprom on top of test clip as this could
seat eprom lower into adapter and cause bad contact.  To remove
test clip pull locking wedge up to unlock the eprom test clip
adapter from the eprom in the phone.  Continue pulling up to lift
the eprom test clip adapter from the eprom in the phone.

STRAIGHT FROM A CELLULAR ONE DEALER DUMPSTER!!!  Date Dec 8, 1995
(appears EXACTLY like it is on the fax)

CAP code, which is the pager's ESN, can be found in 2 places:
	
	1)  The back of the pager (bar code)
	    For example:
	    1st number: 929.7125 = frequency
	    2nd number: 1234567  = CAP code
	    3rd number: 12345678 9s = Factory serial number
			      or
	2)  When the pager is off:  press top button twice
		  and view CAP code, press a 3rd time and
		  view frequency

This fax didn't say what type of pager it is, so let me know when you try this
if it worked or not.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: BRAVO pagers - undocumented test features


SELF TEST:
     TO PUT UNIT INTO A SELF TEST TURN OFF PAGER. NOW HOLD DOWN THE
GRAY ARROW KEY AND BLACK LOCK KEY AT THE SAME TIME AND TURN ON
PAGER. THIS TELLS THE CPU IN PAGER TO GO INTO A SELF TEST. YOU WILL
GET A 2 SECOND LONG BEEP, RELEASE THE GRAY & BLACK BUTTON AND PUSH
THE GRAY BUTTON BEFORE THE 2 SECOND BEEP ENDS. IF YOU DID ALL THIS
IN TIME YOU WILL HAVE "SPL" OR "PAGING P?" AND NOT THE DOTTED LINE
YOU ARE USED TO SEEING WHEN YOU TURN ON PAGER . BY PRESSING THE
GRAY KEY IT WILL GO TO A DISPLAY TEST, PRESS AGAIN AND YOU WILL GET
THE PAGERS CAPCODE (CAPCODE IS THE UNIQUE SERIAL NUMBER WHICH THE
PAGING TRANSMITTERS TRANSMITS TO YOUR PAGER TO TURN ON YOUR PAGER
WHEN SOMEONE PAGES YOU). WAIT AND IN ABOUT 3 SECONDS IT WILL
DISPLAY YOUR SECOND CAPCODE (IF YOU HAVE ONE-MOST DON'T) PRESS THE
GRAY KEY AGAIN AND IT WILL CHECK CONTROLS, PRESS IT AGAIN AND IT
WILL TEST VIBRATOR FUNCTION (IF YOUR PAGER HAS IT). TURN OFF PAGER
AND TURN ON AGAIN TO DISABLE SELF TEST.

SPECIAL PROGRAMMED FEATURES:
     TAKE OFF BATTERIES CLIP AND IN CENTER TOWARD THE FRONT OF
PAGER YOU WILL SEE A PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD EDGE PINS (JUST LIKE THE
BACK SIDE OF A NETENDO CARTAGE. THIS EDGE PINS ARE PLUGGED INTO A
CORE PROGRAMMER. THE PROGRAMMER CAN CHANGE.

     CAPCODES: SEE ABOVE

     AUTORESET TO MANUAL: YOUR PAGER IN AUTORESET WILL BEEP 8 TIMES
THEN STOP BEEPING. MANUAL RESET THE BEEPER WILL KEEP BEEPING TILL
THE COWS COME HOME OR YOU PUSH A BUTTON TO LOOK AT THE MESSAGE.

     DISPLAY: ENGLISH PROMPTS OR INTERNATIONAL-SYMBOL SCREENS
DISPLAYED.

     SILENT MODE CHIRP: FOR A SINGLE BEEP WHEN YOUR PAGED. NOT FOR
USE ON VIBRATOR PAGERS.

     BEEP ON BAD DATA: YOUR PAGER HEARS IT'S CAPCODE BUT RECEIVED
BAD DISPLAY MESSAGE, IT WILL PUT "EEE" ACROSS DISPLAY TO SHOW BAD
RECEIVE. IF THIS IS FEATURE IS NOT ENABLED AND YOU RECEIVE BAD DATA
YOUR PAGER WILL NOT BEEP AND YOU WILL HAVE NO IDEA SOMEONE TRYED TO
PAGE YOU.

     
******************************************************************
NOW LETS SAY YOU ARE UNHAPPY WITH YOUR PAGING COMPANY "A" BUT OWN
YOUR PAGER. YOUR $200.00+ PAGER IS TUNED TO THEIR FREQUENCY AND YOU
WANT TO GO TO ANOTHER PAGING COMPANY BUT NOT LOSE ALL THE MONEY YOU
SPENT FOR YOUR PAGER. THE ANSWER IS TO RE-CRYSTAL PAGER TO THE NEW
FREQUENCY OF COMPANY "B". BUT WE MUST ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS FIRST
TO SEE WHAT IT WILL COST. 

     1. WHAT IS YOUR PAGERS CODING FORMAT (POCSAG) OR (GSC)
	  THE EASY WAY TO TELL IS TO DO A SELF TEST AND READ
	  CAPCODE. IF IT'S 7 NUMBERS IT'S POCSAG. IF IT'S 6 NUMBERS
	  AND 1 LETTER IT'S GSC. IF YOUR PAGER DOES NOT MATCH THE
	  SAME CODING FORMAT AS COMPANY "B" IT WILL COST MORE THEN
	  IT'S WORTH TO CHANGE.

     2. WHAT BAUD RATE IS YOUR PAGER WORKING AT ? DO SELF TEST AND
IF DISPLAY SHOWS PAGING P1 PAGER IS WORKING AT 1200 BAUD OTHER WISE
YOU ARE SAFE TO ASSUME 512 BAUD IT MUST MATCH COMPANY "B" BAUD RATE
TO BE WORTH YOUR TIME.

     3. ARE YOU IN THE SAME FREQUENCY BAND 931 MHZ OR 450 MHZ ETC.
IF COMPANY "A" AND COMPANY "B" ARE NOT IN SAME BAND IT WILL TAKE A
NEW RECEIVER BOARD TO CONVERT PAGER AND COST TO MUCH TO TRY.

     IF ALL THE ANSWERS ABOVE SHOW YOU ARE COMPATIBLE YOU CAN CALL
COMPANY "B" AND TELL THEM YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AND
NEED A CAPCODE NUMBER SO YOU CAN GET PAGER RECRYSTALED AND HAVE A
CAPCODE PROGRAMMED AT THE SAME TIME.

     NOW YOU CAN HAVE COMPANY "B" RECOMMEND A SHOP THAT WILL
RE-CRYSTAL PAGER OR LOOK UP ONE YOURSELF.

(sorry for the all caps, that was how I received it and I am lazy.   -ML)

DISCLAIMER:  I, Mike Larsen, accept NO responsibility for people using any
info within this text for fraudulent purposes.  I did not intend for the info
to be used towards fraud or theft of services.  The main reason I spent 
hundreds of hours creating and compiling this information is because 
programming fees are BULLSHIT and they know it.  
	Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention in the above disclaimer that I do
nothing fraudulent with MY fone.  I pay a bill and everything and can prove 
it.  So will the "feds" or whoever the Internet gestapo is that's been sending
me mail about me being under their "watchful eye", please go for someone else
that's dealing child pornography or asking for WaReZ?  Thanks.
	The sole reason I compiled this info into book form is to let people
that are capable, work on their phone.  I did not compile this for the sole 
purpose of fraud.  There is a company in Illinois called BIG BOYZ TOYZ who are
a bunch of complete FUCKZ who refused to give me my security code and/or
programing manual.  Phrack published a tidbit about it a few issues back and
I figured if I was going to go through all the trouble of learning all of this,
I might as well let everybody share it.  By the way, if you ever see a BIG
BOYZ TOYZ store, they charge WAY too much for everything and will go for list 
price unless you know the going price.
